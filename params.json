For example, if you want to create ListGrid widget, you must use directive 'iscListGrid' as a tag name or attribute.\r\n\r\nEach property of ISC control which can be put in create(props) function or set by a setter, can be determined through attribute with prefix 'sc-' and a name of a property. For example, for the property showEdges you must add attribute sc-show-edges=\"true\". All 'sc-' attributes values are evaluated before use, i.e. all strings must be quoted with single-quotes (sc-name=\"'Hello world!'\" or sc-name=\"'Hello {{name}}!'\").\r\n\r\nIn order to subscribe to ISC control events you must use the attributes with prefix 'sc-on-'.\r\n\r\nAlso you can initialize ISC control by passing config object through attribute 'sc-config-object'.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
